Here's a revised version of your README file to reflect that you're making a business directory React Native app:

---

# Business Directory React Native App

This is a Business Directory application built using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native. The app allows users to browse and interact with various business listings.

## Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure to install all necessary dependencies before running the app:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**

   Launch the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   After starting the app, you'll see options to open it in:

   - [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox environment for Expo apps

## Project Structure

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Reset the Project

To reset the project and start fresh, use the following command:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start building your business directory app from scratch.
